            <p>Hi, I’m Shilpa, a Research Assistant and Customer Engineer with a master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence (cum laude) and years of experience in engineering and research. I have had the opportunity to work on real-world projects, which have significantly shaped my career.</p>
            <p>My work has been recognized with the Pioneer Competitive Research Award, motivating me to continue pushing the boundaries of technology. One of the notable projects I worked on involved enhancing robot navigation and object handling. In this project, we developed a robot capable of moving inside a storage room, picking items from one location and placing them in another, while also comparing task performance between male and female operators to optimize the robot's efficiency.</p>
            <p>In addition to this, I have worked on designing a user-friendly chat application with deep learning models and developed a real-time object detection system using YOLO on Raspberry Pi4. My technical skill set includes Python, Java, C/C++, and various AI/ML technologies, along with expertise in Hadoop, Spark, virtual machines, Docker, React.js, Django, and AWS.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I am passionate about leveraging my skills to address real-world challenges and contribute to innovative projects. If you’re interested in learning more about my work or exploring potential collaborations, feel free to get in touch!</p>
