            <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1YhzlKJQJm2A2H73012pxXfOB3rPJHRhq" alt="Photo of Shilpa" class="profile-photo" style="width:200px;height:auto;">
            
            <p>I’m Shilpa, a passionate and innovative Research Assistant and Customer Engineer with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Engineering. My journey in the tech world has been driven by a deep curiosity and a desire to create impactful solutions that address real-world challenges.</p>
            
            <p>My academic foundation is in Artificial Intelligence, where I graduated cum laude with a master’s degree. During my studies, I delved into complex algorithms, machine learning models, and their applications, laying the groundwork for my current expertise. My research was recognized with the Pioneer Competitive Research Award, which further fueled my passion for pushing the boundaries of AI and engineering.</p>
            
            <p>Throughout my career, I’ve had the privilege of working on a range of innovative projects. One of the most challenging and rewarding was developing a robotic system that could autonomously navigate a storage room, efficiently picking and placing items. This project required a deep understanding of robotics, AI, and human-robot interaction, as we also analyzed task performance differences between male and female operators to optimize the system’s efficiency.</p>
            
            <p>In addition to robotics, I’ve developed a user-friendly chat application using deep learning models, and a real-time object detection system implemented with YOLO on Raspberry Pi4. These projects have honed my skills in Python, Java, C/C++, AI/ML technologies, and platforms like Hadoop, Spark, Docker, React.js, Django, and AWS.</p>
            
            <p>My technical expertise spans across a variety of platforms and languages, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Programming Languages: Python, Java, C/C++</li>
                <li>AI/ML Technologies: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn</li>
                <li>Data Tools: Hadoop, Spark, SQL</li>
                <li>Web Development: React.js, Django</li>
                <li>Cloud Platforms: AWS (S3, EC2, Lambda)</li>
                <li>Other Tools: Docker, Git, Virtual Machines</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Beyond my professional life, I have a deep love for nature and photography. Capturing the world through my lens offers me a fresh perspective, which often inspires my approach to solving complex problems. I also enjoy gardening and outdoor activities, which keep me grounded and connected to the natural world.</p>
            
            <p>Looking ahead, I am eager to continue exploring the intersections of AI, robotics, and human-centered design. My goal is to lead projects that not only push technological boundaries but also have a meaningful impact on society. I am particularly interested in exploring how AI can be used to enhance accessibility and improve quality of life for diverse populations.</p>
            
            <p>If my journey resonates with you, or if you’re interested in collaborating on innovative projects, I’d love to connect. Feel free to browse through my portfolio or reach out directly—I’m always excited about new opportunities and ideas.</p>
